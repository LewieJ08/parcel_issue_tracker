# 📦 Parcel Issue Tracker (Data Visualisation with Pandas & Matplotlib)

This Python project uses **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to analyze and visualize parcel delivery issues from a CSV dataset. It lets users interactively filter data and display graphs to understand patterns in parcel problems and solutions.

## 🔧 Features

- Filter issues by `issue_type` and show a **pie chart** of how common it is across the whole dataset.
- View a **bar or line chart** of the total number of parcels for a chosen issue type.
- See how different `solution_type`s (e.g., manual fix, simple fix) relate to specific issues.
- Plot how issues are spread across different **locations**.
- Clean user interface via command-line prompts.

## 📊 Graph Types Used

- **Pie Chart** – Proportion of a specific issue type in the dataset.
- **Bar Chart** – Compare totals for solution types or locations.
- **Line Chart** – Visualise totals over categories like solution type (user can choose line or bar).
